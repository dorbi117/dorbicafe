<h2>Weekly Blog</h2>
<p>My intent is to keep this updated on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. No big grand plans, just some place to jot down my thoughts as I sip my coffee each Saturday morning.</p>

<h3>02/22/2026</h3>

<p>This weekend is our youngest's birthday! She's been really excited to learn about robots. We've watched a few robot building videos, and in her spare time she's been drawing schematics for how to build a robot. She must be quite the roboticist, because it all looks like Greek to me!</p>
<p>I watched a video this weekend about reclaiming the internet for people, instead of accepting that it's now in the hands of a few corporations. It was titled, <b><i>A Web Revival: the Internet didn't die, you're just not on it</i></b>, by the creator <b>onionboots</b>. You can find it <button><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUgOT22F5s">HERE</a></button></p>
<p>I suffer no such grand delusions that this webpage is countering companies like Meta, TikTok, Google, etc. I know that my traffic here will be effectively zero, except for those that I deliberately send the URL to, like family &amp; friends. But it still feels like something that I need to do, if for no other reason that to teach myself HTML.</p>
<p>I grew up in the era of Geocities &amp; Angelfire pages, but never really knew how to make a page of my own. Back when MySpace was around, my profile page was just copy &amp; pasted pre-fabbed HTML layouts. I didn't really do anything to spruce it up, and that was fine for me at the time. But looking back, that was a great opportunity to make something of my own, and to express myself. It's not really a regret, just something that I know I would have enjoyed, had I taken the time to do it.</p>
